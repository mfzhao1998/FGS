 (Include  the corresponding formula in Graphical abstract and Figure 1. We are sorry for the typo in this formula. Although the description of this formula in the text is correct.)
 
WV and DTNP: Rely on ecognition software, the results need to be saved as a TXT file and put into the corresponding folder.

FGS：Need to enter the folder where the txt file is stored，and rely on numpy and matplotlib packages.
